Step 1
To begin with this simple recipe of hot chocolate, put a saucepan on medium flame and heat milk in it. After a boil, add sugar and stir for a few seconds.

Step 2
After that, chop the dark chocolate roughly in a bowl and put it in microwave for 30 seconds. Take out the bowl and give it a stir. Then, microwave it again and let the chocolate melt for another 30 seconds. Repeat this step in intervals of 30 seconds till the chocolate is entirely melted.

Step 3
The milk will be ready by now. So, add the melted chocolate to the boiling milk and whisk it once to mix it well. Then, add vanilla extract in the end and let it cook for a minute.

Step 4
After the hot chocolate is made, turn off the flame and pour it in large cups. Serve immediately, garnished with marshmallows. Note that whipped cream can also be used as garnish.
